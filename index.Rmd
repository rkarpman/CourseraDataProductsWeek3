## The trees data set 

This data set provides the dimensions of 31 felled cherry trees.

* Girth: tree diameter in inches.
* Height: height in feet.
* Volume: timber volume in cubic feet.

## Height versus girth for trees

Bubble size is proportional to volume.
```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(trees, x = ~Height, y = ~Girth, size = ~Volume,
              type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
              hoverinfo = "text",
              text = ~paste('Volume: ', Volume,
                            '<br> Height: ', Height,
                            '<br> Girth: ', Girth))
```

## Observations

* As expected, volume increases with height and girth.
* Girth appears to have a larger impact than height.
* Small changes in girth lead to large changes in volume.
